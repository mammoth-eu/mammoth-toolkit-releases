description: "Creates a model card using FairBench. The card includes as many fairness\
  \ stamps as\n    applicable, and includes caveats and recommendations from a socio-technical\
  \ database.\n    All stamps summarize the behavior across population groups or subgraphs,\n\
  \    where intersectional subgroups may be created for analysis of edge cases.\n\
  \n    Args:\n        intersectional: Whether to consider all non-empty group intersections\
  \ during analysis. This does nothing if there is only one sensitive attribute.\n\
  \        pairwise_comparison: Whether to compare groups pairwise. Otherwise, each\
  \ group is compared to the whole population.\n    "
