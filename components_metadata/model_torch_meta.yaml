description: "Loads a pytorch model that comprises a Python code initializing the\n\
  \    architecture and a file of trained parameters. For safety, the architecture's\n\
  \    definition is allowed to directly import only specified libraries.\n\n    Args:\n\
  \        state_path: The path in which the architecture's state is stored.\n   \
  \     model_path: The path in which the architecture's initialization script resides.\
  \ Alternatively, you may also just paste the initialization code in this field.\n\
  \        model_name: The variable in the model path's script to which the architecture\
  \ is assigned.\n        safe_libraries: A comma-separated list of libraries that\
  \ can be imported.\n    "
